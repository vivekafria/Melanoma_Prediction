## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
-The class rebalance helped in reducing overfititng of the data and thus the losss is being reduced But it reduced the Acurracy very low

-Initially we tried without the ImageDataGenerator which created data to over fit at high ratio

-Then we introduced dropout and ImageDataGenerator which reduced the over fit

-At last we tried Batch Normalization and Augumentation which really helped in carry forward
